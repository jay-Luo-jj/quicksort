## Getting Started

 - Make sure you have node. You may need to download from https://nodejs.org/en/download/
 - Download Composer from https://getcomposer.org/composer-stable.phar
 - Move `composer-stable.phar` to this folder
 - If using uni controller:
    - Open a terminal using the "server console" button
    - Run `cd www`
 - Run `php composer-stable.phar install`
 - Run `npm i`
 - Run `npm run production`

This will get your project setup and working. When editing any SCSS files, you
will need to have `npm run watch` running in a terminal to ensure your changes
update on the page.
